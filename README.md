## üìù Description
Aerovia Airlines ‚úàÔ∏è, an internationally renowned airline, is determined to offer its passengers an exceptional travel experience. To achieve this goal, the company has decided to launch an in-depth analysis of the data collected from its customers. 

Project goal:
- Objective: Identify and resolve issues affecting service quality, focusing on the main causes of passenger dissatisfaction.

## :mag: Data Cleansing
* Filled missing values using mean strategy.
* Changed certain satisfaction columns where their values were equal to 0 to 3 (mean) as clarified in the specifications (0: Not Applicable; 1-5).
* Dropped rows where their object column values were missing since they only represented a very small portion of the whole data around 2%.
* Deleted columns where their values were sequentially assigned numbers, such as IDs.
* Merged 'Departure Delay in Minutes' and 'Arrival Delay in Minutes' into one column called 'Total Delay' by adding their values.
* Applied label (binary) and ordinal encoders to the appropriate object columns.
* Created boxplots for each column to check for outliers. Here is a box plot for Flight Distance column:

* Ploted histograms for each column to see if the data is balanced or not:

* Ploted heat map for correlation matrix:

The correlation Matrix shows that there is:
- Moderate negative relationship between "Type of travel" and the target column "Satisfaction" (-0.45): meaning that when "Type of travel" is 0 (Business travel) the passenger is satisfied and when it's 1 (Personal travel) their satisfaction is often neutral or dissatisfied.
- Moderate positive relationship between "Class, Online boarding" and the target column "satisfaction" (0.49 & 0.55).
Weak positive relationship between "Inflight entertainement, Seat comfort, On-boarding service, Leg room service & Cleanliness" and the target column "satisfaction" (0.4, 0.35, 0.32, 0.31 & 0.31 respectively).

* Applied the standard scaler since there were outliers within the data (as show in box plot).
* Created the data pipeline encompassing all data preprocesing steps for later use in modeling.

## :desktop_computer:	Modeling
* Utilizing the previous data pipeline. I partitioned the data into two sets: 75% designated for training and 25% allocated for testing. Also, I used the StratifiedShuffleSplit to ensure representative stratification across the dataset.
* Employed 6 distinct classification models, systematically assessing for overfitting through cross-validation techniques. Subsequently, I computed various evaluation metrics for each model and discerned the optimal choice based on the precision score:

* Conducted hyper-parameter tuning for eXtream Gradient Boosting Classifier, meticulously exploring various settings to ascertain the most effective combination for optimal performance:

* Tested the final model on the test set and got even better results:

* Retested the final model on the whole entry dataset and got excellent results:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Feature Importance
* Here is a chart showing the sorted contribution of each column to the target column "satisfaction":

## üéØ Recommendations
* I tweaked the top 5 contributing features' values:
  - Online boarding satisfaction: capped to at least 4.
  - Type of Travel: changed to Business Travel (dissatisfactkon count: 14294 -> 10663).
  - Class: changed to Business.
  - Inflight wifi service satisfaction: increased to at least 4 (dissatisfactkon count: 14294 -> 12834).
  - Customer Type: limited to Loyal Customers (dissatisfactkon count: 14294 -> 12704).

* Here some recommendations to reduce dissatisfaction rate:
  - Conduct a detailed analysis to identify and address specific pain points.
  - Improve the overall boarding journey, including pre-boarding and boarding.
  - Maintain the premium in-flight services.
  - Enhance services and amenities for non-business travelers.
  - Enhance service quality, comfort, and additional amenities for non-business class passengers.
  - Invest in faster and more reliable internet access.
  - Offer different tiers of service to cater to varying customer needs.
  - Reward frequent flyers with personalized services and benefits.
  - Focus on maintaining and improving satisfaction among loyal customers.
  
## üî® Conclusion
To effectively enhance overall customer satisfaction, the airline should prioritize enhancing services for non-business travelers, investing in reliable inflight WiFi, and strengthening loyalty programs. These targeted strategies address key areas that directly impact customer experience and satisfaction, leading to a more satisfied and loyal customer base.
